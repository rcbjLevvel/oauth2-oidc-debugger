# OAuth2 + OpenID Connect Debugger
This is a simple OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) debugger (test tool) that I created as part of a Red Hat SSO blog post I wrote in November, 2017.  The blog post uses this debugger for testing the OpenID Connect setup.  So, checkout the blog for usage examples. This project builds a docker container that runs the debugger application.

# This project is now located [here](https://github.com/rcbj/oauth2-oidc-debugger).
